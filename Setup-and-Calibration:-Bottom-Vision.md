# Bottom Vision
Bottom Vision allows OpenPnP to more precisely place parts by checking their offset and rotation on the nozzle after picking. It requires a Bottom Camera to be configured and there are some extra steps for making sure you get the best results.

Bottom Vision is a large and complex topic, and has it's own section of the Wiki. See [[Bottom Vision]] for more details.
