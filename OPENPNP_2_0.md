## Getting Started with OpenPnP 2.2

Be sure to check out the Issues & Solutions system to help you setup your initial machine
configuration or use the latest feature after an upgrade. Go to the Issues & Solutions tab and work 
through the suggested steps. 

See the [Instructions in the Wiki](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Issues-and-Solutions).

## If you upgraded from OpenPnP 1.0

Your configuration is safe.

OpenPnP 2.0 is a major update to OpenPnP and includes many new features and changes to existing
features. As part of this upgrade, you will need to reconfigure your machine, but don't panic. Your
old configuration is still available and you can downgrade back to 1.0 very easily. Keep reading.

OpenPnP uses a new configuration directory. Instead of .openpnp it uses .openpnp2. Your old
configuration, if you had one, is still in .openpnp. If you would like to downgrade back to
1.0 please [download the Legacy version](https://openpnp.org/downloads/).
