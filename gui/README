file is in.

Configuration
=============

Configuration files are located in the config subdirectory. The following
files are used:

openpnp.xml		Contains the primary program and machine configuration.

packages.xml	Describes various packages for SMT parts.

parts.xml		Describes parts that the machine can pick and place.

btpd-v4.job.xml	A sample Job file, showing how to configure a Job for
				processing.


Development
===========

There is an Eclipse project in this directory that should get you most
of the way started.

If you do not use Eclipse, the project is pretty straight forward to 
import into your IDE of choice. Include the jars in lib as dependencies.

You will need JOGL ( http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/ ) on your classpath to
compile and run the project. If you are using Eclipse, define a User
Library called JOGL that includes at least:
	glugen-rt.jar
	jogl.all.jar
	nativewindow.all.jar
	newt.all.jar

JOGL binaries can be found at http://jogamp.org/deployment/webstart/archive/

The main class to start the program is org.openpnp.app.Main.

To run the simulator and see things happen, load btpd-v4.xml from the config 
directory.
