/**
 * <p>
 * The MotionPlanner coordinates motion, homing etc. across multiple drivers. It has a similar interface as the 
 * drivers themselves and acts as a black box to abstract from the complexities of multiple, mixed drivers.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In OpenPnP, the Head does not move on it's own. It is moved by the moving of attached objects:
 * Nozzles, Cameras, Actuators, so-called HeadMountables. The HeadMountables specify by which axes 
 * they are moved. The axes are in turn assigned to the Driver. When you move a HeadMountable the 
 * MotionPlanner will determine which axes are involved and call the drivers accordingly.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>The Motion planner may also perform advanced motion planning i.e. it might reorder, blend and interpolate the 
 * original moveTo() commands in order to improve performance, reduce machine vibrations etc.</p>
 * 
 * <p>These are the most important tasks:</p>  
 * <ul>
 * <li>Perform home() commands across drivers.</li>
 * <li>Accept a sequence of original moveTo() commands.</li>
 * <li>Coordinate motion across multiple drivers.</li>
 * <li>For advanced MotionPlanners, perform optimization on the sequence. </li>
 * <li>As soon as the motion is commited i.e. when waiting for completion, command the drivers to plan and execute the plan.</li>
 * <li>Provide access to the planned motion over time for coordination, simulation, visualization etc. </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A MotionPlanner can be a simple proxy, just sending commands directly to the drivers. See the 
 * NullMotionPlanner. Future advanced MotionPlanners can do nth order Kinematics control, motion blending
 * etc. 
 * </p><p>
 * The MotionPlanner is an envelope planner i.e. it will only plan the maximum velocity, acceleration, jerk 
 * allowed to the controller. It is not a real-time planner, therefore the real physical motion that is later executed 
 * by the controller, might be more constrained i.e. take more time. Having said that, it remains a goal to anticipate 
 * the controller's motion as good as possible, so that simulation and reality will be very similar and optimizations 
 * are purposeful. 
 * </p><p>
 * An advanced Planner will first record the commands and it may (or may not yet) plan the moves. 
 * A waitForCompletion() will force the planning and generate the needed output commands. Note that proper
 * envelope motion control is only possible for complete moves, because the the planner must know when to
 * decelerate in time. 
 * </p><p>
 * Sometimes, motion might be recorded but no immediate waitForCompletion() is wanted. The most prominent
 * example is jogging, where the planner never knows if and when the user will press another button.  
 * In this case up-front envelope motion planning is impossible, at least for the deceleration part. 
 * Therefore motion control is mostly left to the hardware controller, perhaps with more conservative 
 * deceleration parameters. 
 * </p><p>
 * The MotionPlanner must plan all the Axes of the machine, across all the Drivers. Therefore driver/controller
 * specific behavior must be modeled per Axis. The MotionPlanner should also try to approximate coordinated 
 * motion across controllers. A best-effort approximation should be enough for PnP purposes.  
 * </p><p>
 * Unless Length and Location are used, units are Millimeters and Seconds.
 * </p>
