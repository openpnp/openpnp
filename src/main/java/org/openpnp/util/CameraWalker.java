/**
 * A CameraWalker iteratively moves the machine to drive some detectable feature in a camera image 
 * to a specific point in the image.  This works for both top and bottom cameras and does not 
 * require the camera to be completely setup or calibrated, i.e., settings for rotation, flips, 
 * units per pixel, and lens distortion are all irrelevant to its operation. However, it does need 
 * a function to detect the feature in the image.
 * <p>
 * The feature detection function will typically process a CvPipeline to detect the feature. It is 
 * important that the stages used in the pipeline have no dependencies on any of the aforementioned
 * uncalibrated settings. To aid in the detection, the function is passed a point in image 
 * coordinates where the feature is expected to be found and can be used to select the search area 
 * and/or mask-off regions of the image that may cause false detections.  The function should return
 * either the image coordinates of the feature if it is found or null if the feature could not be 
 * found.
 * <p>
 * The size of each step a CameraWalker takes is normally determined by the distance between the 
 * detected feature image coordinates and its desired image coordinates. That distance is scaled by 
 * the loopGain (defaults to 0.7 but can be changed using the {@link #setLoopGain setLoopGain} 
 * method) to determine the step size. The maximum size of the steps a CameraWalker takes can be 
 * further limited by using the {@link #setMaxAllowedPixelStep setMaxAllowedPixelStep} and/or 
 * {@link #setMaxAllowedMachineStep setMaxAllowedMachineStep} methods.
 * <p>
 * The walk is considered done when the distance between the detected feature image coordinates and 
 * its desired image coordinates no longer decreases. The walk can also be completed if the detected 
 * feature is within a set distance (in pixels) of the desired image coordinates or if the machine 
 * step is below a set distance (in machine units). These can be set with the 
 * {@link #setMinAllowedPixelStep setMinAllowedPixelStep} (defaults to 0) and {@link 
 * #setMinAllowedMachineStep setMinAllowedMachineStep} (defaults to 0.0001 mm) 
 * methods respectively.
 * <p>
 * By default, a CameraWalker will only make safe Z moves; however, that behavior can be changed
 * by using the {@link #setOnlySafeZMovesAllowed setOnlySafeZMovesAllowed} method.
