OpenPnP Icon Specifications
===========================


Common Themes
=============
The current icon set has some common elements that are used across multiple
icons. It is not necessary to use these exact same elements, but some thought
should be given to maintaining a set of common elements across sets of features
that are shared.

Capturing
---------
Several icons express the concept of capturing data from one place and storing
it in another. For instance, there is an icon that captures the current
coordinates of the camera and stores them in a location field.

Capturing is identified by a square, blue outline as the primary design element.

Positioning
-----------
Icons that are used to indicate that the machine will perform a positioning
movement are identified by a round, red outline. Red is used to provide a
warning to the user that the machine will make movement in response to
performing the action.

Tool, Actuator and Camera
-------------------------
Several of the above icons are intended to perform their action with regards
to either the tool, actuator or camera. Where possible, these icons all use
a common element across their different functions.

The tool design element is a broken crosshair; four lines extending from the
edges of the outline and not quite meeting in the center.

The actuator design element is similar to that of the tool, except the lines
leave a larger open area in the center and it is filled with a large dot
indicating the actuator pin.

The camera design element is intended to invoke a camera viewfinder. It is an
interrupted rectangle, centered within the outline.

Toolchain
=========
I (vonnieda) currently use AutoDesk Graphic on Mac for icon editing. I particularly like
that I can put icons on several layers, name them based on the filenames used in OpenPnP
and then export them all at once. This is very helpful for aligning icons and making
sure they use similar design elements.
