# Version 2.3

## New Features

* Added the Pre-Rotate All Nozzles optimisation which provides a speed enhancement in situations where the rotation takes longer then the actual XY move eg when moving the second nozzle over the bottom camera and reduces the risk of parts slipping on nozzles. [PR 1654](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1654)
* A right-click menu to copy the machine position to the clipboard [PR 1727](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1727)
* Prevent unintended changes when a single click on a table row from opening cell editor or makes checkbox action. This now requires a second click. [PR 1729](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1729)
* Added the "Through-Board Depth" property to Parts. This can be used to record the height of any mechanical alignment pips, through-hole electrical pins, lenses on down-firing leds, and connectors with features that overhang the side of the board. This additional height is considered in Safe-Z calculations when moving such parts on a nozzle tip. [PR 1749](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1749)
* Added support for driver-side delaying using G4 P<> and uses it for static pick and place dwell time. This provides a better and tighter utilization of the machine while reducing the scheduler induced timing jitter. [PR 1699](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1699)
* Additional placement sorting options to the job processor making the order of placements predictable even for panels of identical boards. [PR 1658](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1658)
* Avoid unnecessary "Feeder X changed. Apply changes?" messages. [PR 1773](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1773)
* Many translation improvements. [PR 1658](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1658) [PR 1704](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1704)
* Change camera view zoom behaviour from linear to log. [PR 1766](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1766)
* Added "Skip Next Feed" and "Disable Feed" feeder options. This provides limited recycle support to some feeders that previously had none. [PR 1716](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1716)
* Changes related to scripting:
  * A performance improvement for scripting events, for the common case where events do not have any scripts configured. Openpnp now remembers that the script does not exist and can skip a filesystem check on the next time that event is triggered. NB scripting users need to use the 'Clear Scripting Engine Pool' menu after adding a script, in the same manner as is needed when changing a script. [PR 1744](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1744)
  * The 'Job.Placement.BeforeAssembly' event now allows any scripts to fine-tune the location of the placement. This enables script-based 'local fiducial' behaviour. [PR 1688](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1688)
  * Added the `config.scriptState` object to hold state which is shared between scripts. This is stored in the `script-state.xml` file. [PR 1778](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1778)
* Improvements to the part footprint camera overlay:
  * A marker to indicate the part orientation, typically pad #1, cathode, etc. [PR 1694](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1694)
  * Draw that overlay on bottom camera too. [PR 1745](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1745)
* Improvements to the manual jog interface:
  * Pressing the shift key reduces jog distance by 100x. [PR 1710](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1710)
  * Remember the position of the jog distance slider when OpenPnP is restarted. [PR 1690](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1690)
  * The jog buttons are disabled when a modal dialog box is shown. This prevents having multiple nested error message boxes when jogging into a soft limit. [PR 1761](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1761)
* Improvements for strip feeders:
  * A performance improvements relating to vision. It (optionally) no longer checks every single hole. [PR 1662](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1662)
  * A parallax vision feature for transparent tape where the holes can be difficult to see when viewed from above [PR 1713](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1713)
* Changes to fiducial vision. NB update your vision pipeline to include these new features:
  * The MatchTemplate vision pipeline stage now supports the 'center' and 'maxDistance' properties. The standard 'Footprint Fiducial' pipeline now support parallax vision features. [PR 1719](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1719)
  * All Fiducial pipelines now have a 'Max Distance' gui slider to control the detection range. This allows different fiducial pipelines to have different ranges, for example a panel fiducial might benefit from a larger detection range, and a board fiducial might benefit from a shorter detection range to avoid mis-detecting other board features. [PR 1719](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1719)

# 2023-05-03

Removed state from AbstractMachine. This might cause problems loading machine.xml in
the unlikely event that you configured a ActuatorSignaler with a non empty machine state.
To fix this, either remove the binding to machine state be setting it to empty before 
the upgrade or remove "MachineState" manually from the signalers section of your machine.xml.

Behaviour of ActuatorSignaler changed to only call the actuator if the job state has changed.

# 2023-05-02

Named CSV importer renamed to Reference CSV importer

Altium CSV importer added which accepts the default center-x/center-y columns and
correctly handles the rotation of bottom side parts.

# 2023-03-14

## Java 17+ Support

OpenPnP is now compatible with Java versions 11, 17, and 19. Thank you to @lags
and others! See the PR at [PR 1493](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1493) for more
details.

Other versions of Java are no longer explicity supported or tested but they may
still work. In general, any version 11+ should work.

The installers now include a current version of OpenJDK 17, rather than a very
out of date JDK 8.

## MacOS Silicon Support and Fixes

OpenPnP now supports Apple Silicon natively, including in openpnp-capture and
openpnp-opencv.

OpenPnP Capture Camera is now fixed on MacOS and should work correctly on both
x86 and Apple Silicon.

This version of OpenPnP changes from a installer to a single app archive.
You can install it by dragging the app to your /Applications folder.

The application and supporting files are now Code Signed so that they should
run without having to disable security.


# 2023-02-26

## Board Z

Changed the Capture Tool Location button on the Job table to only update the Z
and not the X, Y, or Rotation of the selected board. Also added the capability
to update multiple boards to the same Z value.

[PR 1527](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/1527)

# 2023-02-14

## Panelization and other UI changes/improvements

Panels are now stand-alone entities much like boards. They are now stored in *.panel.xml files
rather than being "built-into" the job file. Panels can now have arbitrary layouts and can consist
of any number of different boards and/or subpanels. Many of the issues issues that have been
reported with the legacy panelization method have been fixed.

Two new tabs have been added to the UI. The Panels tab is the primary area for creating and editing
panels. The Boards tab is now the primary areas for creating and editing boards. The Job tab is now
primarily for selecting boards and/or panels (defined on the aforementioned tabs) to be assembled, 
setting their location and orientation on the machine and, of course, executing the job.

There is now a button on the Job tab (the Panels and Boards tabs have one as well) that opens a 
graphical viewer that displays the physical layout of the job (or Panel or Board).

The column widths on the Job, Panels, and Boards tabs are now remembered between OpenPnP sessions.
Numeric columns on those tabs are also now aligned on their decimal points.
