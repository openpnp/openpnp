## 2020-04-16 Update

If you would like to add a new feature to OpenPnP that changes core or reference functionality,
please create a topic on the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/openpnp) to discuss
the feature first. Also consider if your feature can be implemented as a new subclass of
a Reference class, or an entirely new class, instead of changing or adding to the Reference
class.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Description
Describe the change in detail. Explain how it works. The better you describe the change the more likely it is to be accepted.

# Justification
Why should this change be included in OpenPnP? Does it benefit a majority of users or is it specific to one type of user or machine? Machine specific or highly individual code will not be accepted.

# Instructions for Use
How does someone use the feature? Be descriptive. Include step by step instructions. If this is a new feature then these instructions will become the Wiki documentation for the feature, so explain here the same way you would explain to someone who had never used the feature.

This is documentation for a user, not for a developer.

# Implementation Details
1. How did you test the change? Be descriptive. Untested code will not be accepted.
2. Did you follow the [coding style](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Developers-Guide#coding-style)?
3. If you made changes in the `org.openpnp.spi` or `org.openpnp.model` packages you will need to add additional justification for these changes. Changes to these packages require extensive review and testing.
4. Be sure to run `mvn test` before submitting the Pull Request. If the tests do not pass the Pull Request will not be accepted.
