# OpenPnP

Open Source SMT Pick and Place Hardware and Software

## Introduction

OpenPnP is a project to create the plans, prototype and software for a completely Open Source SMT
pick and place machine that anyone can afford. I believe that with the ubiquity of cheap, precise
motion control hardware, some ingenuity and plenty of Open Source software it should be possible
to build and own a fully functional SMT pick and place machine for under $1000.

## Project Status

OpenPnP is stable and in wide use. It is still under heavy development and new features are added continuously. See the [Downloads](http://openpnp.org/downloads) page to get started.
