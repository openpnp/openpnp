# OpenPnP

Open Source SMT Pick and Place Hardware and Software

## Introduction

OpenPnP is a project to create the plans, prototype and software for a completely Open Source SMT pick and place machine that anyone can afford. I believe that with the ubiquity of cheap, precise motion control hardware, some ingenuity and plenty of Open Source software it should be possible to build and own a fully functional SMT pick and place machine for under $1000.

## Project Status

Overall, the project is in a pre-alpha state. This means that it's under heavy development and there are currently no end-user usable components. We are working hard towards an initial alpha release.

## Get Started

OpenPnP is still under development. If you would like to keep up with our progress you can Watch this project, check out [our Twitter](http://twitter.com/openpnp), or [join the discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/openpnp).
