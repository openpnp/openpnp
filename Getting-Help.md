# Discussion Group
The best way to get help with OpenPnP is to join the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/openpnp) and post a message. New users are moderated until their first on topic message, so your message might be delayed a few hours. Please be patient.

# Live Chat
There is a small but active IRC channel on Freenode called #openpnp. You can join with any IRC client or [use this web based one](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openpnp).

# Submit Diagnostics
If you are having trouble configuring OpenPnP, or you need help with something that is happening in the program, please use the built in Submit Diagnostics function. This function will bundle up important configuration files, images and log files so that the developers can see what is happening with your setup.

1. Turn on trace logging. See https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-turn-on-debug-logging for more information.
2. Restart OpenPnP.
3. Perform whatever actions are causing a problem. Try to do ONLY the minimum needed to show the problem.
4. Go to Menu -> Help -> Submit Diagnostics.
5. Describe the problem in the "Please Describe the Issue" field.
6. Uncheck any boxes you don't want to send but be aware that the more data you send the better.
7. Click Send. Submit Diagnostics will upload the files and then open a URL in your browser. You can look at the page that opens to make sure it's okay.
8. Send the URL to the Discussion Group or the IRC channel.
